            <p>Position is one of the most useful and most complex of all the symbols in GD&amp;T. The two methods of using Position&nbsp;discussed on this page will be RFS or&nbsp; Regardless of Feature Size and under a material condition (Maximum Material
                Condition or Least Material Condition). However, since this is such a useful symbol, we will continue to add content and examples for other uses of this nifty little symbol in the coming months.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Description:</strong></h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">True&nbsp;Position is actually just referred to as Position in the ASME Standard. Many people refer to the symbol as “True” Position, although this would be slightly incorrect. The <strong>Position</strong>&nbsp;tolerance is the GD&amp;T symbol
                and tolerance of location. The <strong>True Position</strong> is the exact coordinate, or location&nbsp;defined by basic dimensions or other means that represents the nominal value. In other words, the GD&amp;T <strong>“Position”</strong>                Tolerance is how far your feature’s location can vary from its <strong>“True Position”</strong>.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Although incorrect, we title this page and may sometimes refer to the symbol as True Position since this is typically the term people are referencing when they are looking for the specified tolerance. However, if you want to be correct to
                the ASME standard, just use the term “Position”.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For true position under MMC of a&nbsp;<strong>pin</strong>:</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Gauge Ø (hole gauge) = Max Ø of pin (MMC) + True Position Tolerance</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2846" src="https://www.gdandtbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/06-True-Position-Max-Material-Condition-Gauging-External.jpg" alt="True Position Max Material Condition Gauging External"
                    width="1182" height="776"></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Locations of the gauge pins or holes are given on the drawing as basic dimensions. All gauge features should be located in the datum true positions, but sized according to the formulas above.</p>
            <h3 style="text-align: justify;">Note on Bonus Tolerance:</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">When a functional gauge is used for True Position, any difference the actual feature size is from the maximum material condition would be a bonus tolerance. The bonus tolerance for position then increases as the part gets closer to LMC. The
                goal of a maximum material condition callout is to ensure that when the part is in its worst tolerances, the True Position <em>and</em> size of the hole/pin will always assemble together. For instance, if you had a large hole size but
                was still in tolerance (closer to LMC), you make more bonus tolerance for yourself making the true position tolerance larger. You can now have the hole center more out of position due to the bonus tolerance.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Bonus Tolerance = Difference between MMC &amp; Actual condition.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Confused? No worries!

            <h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Relation to Other GD&amp;T Symbols:</strong></h2>
            <h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>True Position –Location of a feature</strong></h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">True position is closely related to <a title="Symmetry" href="https://www.gdandtbasics.com/symmetry/">symmetry</a> and <a title="Concentricity" href="https://www.gdandtbasics.com/concentricity/">concentricity</a> as they both require the location
                of features to be controlled. However, True position is more versatile since it can be called on a feature of size or combined with other geometric tolerances to specify an entire part envelope.</p>
            <h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>True Position using features of size (MMC/LMC)</strong></h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">True position with used of MMC or LMC is related to <a title="Perpendicularity" href="https://www.gdandtbasics.com/perpendicularity/">axis perpendicularity</a> when used on a hole or pin. The tolerance of both perpendicularity and true position
                now refers to the uniformity and cylindrical envelope of a central axis. However, with true position you can make the tolerance referenced to several datum’s as opposed to just one with axis perpendicularity. When you callout true position
                using datums on the face, and sides of the part – perpendicularity is controlled as well.&nbsp; See example 2 for more details.</p>
            <h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>When Used:</strong></h2>
            <h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>True Position –Location of a feature</strong></h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">In example 1 you can see how a hole can be called out using true position. However, this can also be applied to anything in need of a location tolerance, such as a pin, a boss or even an edge of a part. When you have a hole in a part such
                as a bolted surface, true position is usually called out. It can be used almost anywhere to <strong>represent any feature of size.</strong></p>
            <h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>True Position using material condition&nbsp;(MMC/LMC)</strong></h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">True position of a feature of size under MMC is used when a functional gauge is ideal for checking the part. True position is also useful for describing and controlling a bolt pattern for a pipe fitting or a bolted fixture. If you specify
                the control using MMC, it allows you to have a pin gauge that you can insert into the part to see if the bolt pattern is functionally accurate. You will see true position called with MMC very commonly in bolt patterns where relative location
                of all the bolts and necessary clearance is critical. LMC with true position is a little less common but often used when minimum wall thickness is desired.</p>
            <h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>True Position –Location of Hole Example 1</strong><strong>:</strong></h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Four holes are to be located on a block to ensure contact is always maintained and located within a specific position. The holes need to line up with the threaded connections in the mating part.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                <a href="https://www.gdandtbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/08-True-Position-Example-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2848 size-full" src="https://www.gdandtbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/08-True-Position-Example-1.jpg" alt="True Position Example 1" width="894" height="615"></a>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">The True position callout on a block</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">With true position called out the holes do not need to be in exact positions as shown below, but their centers can vary by the amount specified by the tolerance. The basic dimensions (dimensions in the squares) are un-toleranced and describe
                the true location the hole would be in if it was perfect. In a 2D check of the upper right hole, the true location would be 40 mm from datum A and 40 mm from datum B. The holes center is calculated, usually by a CMM and compared to the
                true location. As long as the holes center is in the blue tolerance zone of 0.2 mm specified by the feature control frame, the part is in tolerance.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                <a href="https://www.gdandtbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/09-True-Position-Example-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2849" src="https://www.gdandtbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/09-True-Position-Example-2.jpg" alt="True Position Example 2" width="1252" height="649"></a>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Note: in this case, the surface of the part is called out (Datum C). This means the entire hole must have its axis align with the datum. The tolerance zone would actually ensure that the location <em>and</em> the perpendicularity are within
                the specified tolerance. Since all the central points at any cross-section are controlled by true position, the parts axis (line between all central points) would be controlled for orientation.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest thing to note about this design is that no matter what size hole you have, your true position would always have to be the same. This is ideal for when proper exact alignment is required for function of the part. It does, however,
                remove the possibility of using a functional gauge.</p>
            <h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>True Position – Hole size and location using MMC Example 2</strong><strong>:</strong></h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Taking the same example, the true position can also be specified with a maximum material condition callout. This means you are now controlling the envelope of the entire hole feature, including the size of the hole throughout its entire depth.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                <a href="https://www.gdandtbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/10-True-Position-Example-3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2850" src="https://www.gdandtbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/10-True-Position-Example-3.jpg" alt="True Position Example 3" width="985" height="731"></a>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Adding the little “M” makes a big difference.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">With an MMC callout you now can use a functional gauge to measure this part, to determine that the size and geometric tolerancing are within spec at the same time.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Formula for a the functional gauge to measure the true position of all holes:</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Individual Pin Diameters = Min hole Ø -True position tolerance (bonus)</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">This example Pin Ø = 9.9 – 0.2 = Ø 9.7</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Location of pins: Same specifications</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-3132 aligncenter" src="https://www.gdandtbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/11-True-Position-Example-41.jpg" alt="True Position Example 5" width="763" height="635"></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">This would be the go gauge that would measure for hole size, orientation, and position. The part would be pressed down onto the gauge and if it fits the part is in specification. Notice that datum A, B, and C are all included in the gauge
                to check the location of the hole. The desired function of the part is met by ensuring that the part touches all the datums and that the gauge pins are able to fully go through the holes.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                <a href="https://www.gdandtbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/12-True-Position-Example-51.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3131 size-full" src="https://www.gdandtbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/12-True-Position-Example-51.jpg" alt="True Position Example 5" width="735" height="650"></a>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Top view of the part once inserted into pin gauge</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">As long as the gauge can go into the part, it is in spec. This makes it very easy to accurately gauge the part right on a production line. The function of the part is confirmed because as long as the surface that the part is bolted to has
                the same tolerances, it will always fit.</p>
            <h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Final Notes:</strong></h2>
            <h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bonus Round</strong></h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Remember the further you are from MMC when it is referenced in the feature control frame, the more bonus tolerance you are allowed. For a&nbsp;hole, the larger the diameter, (closer to the LMC) the more bonus tolerance you have for your true
                position.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bonus tolerance = true position tolerance (measured hole size – MMC hole size)</strong></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Note: Keep in mind the opposite is true for a positive feature like a pin, where the <em>smaller </em>the pin means you have more bonus tolerance.</p>
            <h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Called with or without the Ø symbol</strong></h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">There are two ways true position can be called out – either as a distance, in X and Y or most commonly as a diameter. When true position is called out as a distance, you are permitted to move from the tolerance in X or Y direction by the allowed
                tolerance. However, when done this way, the tolerance zone actually forms a square. This is usually undesirable since in the corners of the square are further from the center than the sides. This also removed over 57% of your tolerance
                zone!
                <strong>Most commonly, true position with reference to location is called with the diameter (Ø) symbol to be called as a cylindrical or circular tolerance zone.</strong></p>
            <h3 style="text-align: justify;">Slotted<strong>&nbsp;Features:</strong></h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Another common way true position can be called out is with slotted features. If you have a slot in your part that must always be located correctly, you can use true position to ensure that each of the planes that make up the slot are always
                located in the correct position. Symmetry can also be used in this case – but only if the slots have a referenced datum plane that they are symmetrical about (and measuring symmetry is very difficult!).</p>
