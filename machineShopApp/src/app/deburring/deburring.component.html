            <h2>Deburring</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Burr removal, or “deburring,” is a standard practice associated with virtually every segment of the manufacturing process. Burrs are sharp edges resulting from cutting operations and include all metal extending past the theoretical intersection
            of the two surfaces that surround the burr. Although usually small in size, burrs can cause assembly problems, interfere with fluid flow, and are a common cause of worker injury.</p>

        <h4>Characteristics of quality deburring</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>All edges are smooth and uniform</li>
            <li>You can drag your fingernail across any surface, edge or intersection of the part features without catching any edges</li>
            <li>Surfaces tangent to worked edges are free from any scratches or gouging</li>
        </ul>

        <p>There is a large variety of tools that can be used for deburring. Part shapes, material type, size of burr and part tolerances (or specific method defined on the print) are factors when choosing the appropriate tools for the job. Listed below
            are some common tools and methods used for deburring:</p>

        <p>Files: Filing is an industrial art - grip, stroke and pressure may vary, to fit the job. There are three elemental ways a file can be put to work:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Straight filing: This consists of pushing the file lengthwise-straight ahead or slightly diagonally-across the workpiece.</li>
            <li>Draw filing: This consists of grasping the file at each end, pushing and drawing it across the workpiece</li>
            <li>Lathe filing: This consists of stroking the file against work revolving in a lathe</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>File Safety</h4>

        <p>For safety reasons, a file should never be used without a tight fitting handle. Serious accidents can result if the handle becomes detached exposing the sharp point of the tang.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Bonded abrasive finishing (sanding)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Sandpaper sheets</li>
                <li>Belts</li>
                <li>Disks</li>
                <li>Wheels</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Abrasive Blasting</li>
            <li>Mass finishing</li>

                <li>Vibratory/ Tumbling machines</li>

        </ul>
        <h4>Vibratory Equipment</h4>
        <img src="assets/imgs/deburring5.JPG" alt="">

        <h5>Vibratory Operation</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Fill the vibratory above the half way mark in the bowl with appropriate media.</li>
            <li>Start the vibratory and turn the water on to flow at a trickle, just enough to keep the stones wet</li>
            <li>Add parts in batches from 15 to 50 parts depending on part size</li>
            <li>Valve discs (and parts similar to) have a tendency to stick together which prevents exposure to the media resulting in unfinished surfaces and loading too many parts at once exaggerates the problem. Wrapping wire or jack chain around each
                individual part is necessary to ensure uniform finishing. See figure 8.</li>
        </ul>
