            <h4>Username and password setup</h4>
            <p>
              You should have received a user name and password from HR shortly
              after starting on your first day, if you did not tell your
              supervisor. To clock in you go to the website “easyclocking.net”.
              When you first go there you will need to have the company ID
              number. Enter this number followed by your user name and password
              to log in to your main clock in screen.
